## Overview



TimeWise is a sophisticated time series model selection algorithm designed to identify the most accurate forecasting model from a diverse suite. It utilizes a RandomForest classification model for accurate predictions. The system is complemented by a RESTful API built with Flask, providing seamless data upload, precise predictions, and a transparent display of model accuracy. The accuracy is validated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metrics.
